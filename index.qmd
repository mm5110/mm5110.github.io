# Research overview
I use maths to better understand and improve deep learning algorithms.

1)  **Theoretical foundations:** develop theory to reconcile modern phenomena with conventional machine learning wisdom. 

2) **Improving efficiency:** use intuition from theory to identify algorithmic innovations to lower training and inference costs.
