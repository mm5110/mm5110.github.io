**Pre-requisites:** a first course in measure theory, complex numbers, real analysis and probability.

The Stieltjes is a fundamental object in probability and has played a particularly prominent role in Random Matrix Theory. In this note we look at some of its key properties, listed below.

- There is a one-to-one mapping between a probability measure and its Stieltjes transform.
- XXXX


In what follows we consider the measurable space $(\reals, B(\reals))$ where $B(\reals)$ denotes the Borel $\sigma$-algebra and $P_\mu(\reals)$  denotes the set of probability measure $\mu:B(\reals) \rightarrow \reals$. In addition we use $F(\comps)$ to denote the set of complex functions $m:\comps \rightarrow \comps$. The Stieltjes transform $S:P_\mu(\reals) \rightarrow F(\comps)$ maps real probability measures $\mu$ to complex functions.

::: {#def-def}
The Stieltjes transform of $\mu \in \prob(\reals)$ is a complex function $m_{\mu}: \reals  \backslash \supp(\mu) \rightarrow \comps$ defined as
$$
m_{\mu}(z) = \int_{\reals} \frac{1}{t - z} d\mu(t).
$$

The following lemma summarizes some useful properties of the Stieltjes transform.

::: {#lem-lem}
The complex function $m_{\mu} = S(\mu)$ satisfies the following,

1. it exists for any $z \in \comps \backslash \reals$,
2. is analytic on $\comps \backslash \reals$,
3. letting $\gamma_n(\mu) = \int_{\reals}t^n d\mu(t)$ denote the $n$th moment of $\mu$ then $m_{\mu}(z) = - \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{\gamma_n(\mu)}{z^{n+1}}$
:::

In particular, point 1 illustrates that the Stieltjes transform is well defined on its domain. Point 2 implies that in addition to being continuous and infinitely differentiable the Stieltjes transform at each point in its domain can be expressed in terms of a power series (Taylor expansion), power series are advantagoes as they are amenable both to manipulation and numerical computation. Finally, and in fact based on 2, point 3 relates the Stieltjes transform to the moments of the measure in question.
