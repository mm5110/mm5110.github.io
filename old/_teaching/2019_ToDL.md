Teaching Assistant for undergraduate and masters course Theories of Deep Learning, taught by Prof. Jared Tanner. Course surveyed a range of theories and principles to explain various phenomena concerning deep learning, for example, but not limited to, connections with dictionary learning and transferability of early layers, energy decay with depth, Lipschitz continuity of the net, how depth overcomes the curse of dimensionality, constructing adversarial examples, geometry of nets viewed through random matrix theory, and learning of invariance.
