First post describing the purpose of this blog!

Blog purpose
======
My plan for this blog is to write about topics broadly related to my research. My aim is to use it as a platform to review and process talks I have attended, summarise trends in the field and in general just share anything I think is interesting. In doing so my plan is to improve my writing and as well as my understanding. If anyone finds any of these posts interesting or useful thats a great added bonus!
